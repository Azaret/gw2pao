Guild Wars 2 Personal Assistant Overlay
======

# Description

A stand-alone .NET/WPF informational overlay utility for Guild Wars 2.

# Features
Currently, the GW2 Personal Assistant Overlay includes 10 overlay utilities:


## Events Tracker
The Events Tracker overlay tracks active and inactive world events, and allows a user to keep track of which events have already been completed for the day.

## Event Notifications
Event Notifications are notification pop-ups that appear when a world event is about to start.

## Zone Completion Assistant
The Zone Completion Assistant displays real-time distance and direction information for zone completion points/locations and provides several options for keeping track of unlocked locations.

## Dungeon Tracker
The Dungeon Tracker is a simple overlay tool that allows a user to keep track of what dungeon paths have been completed for the day, and provides some basic information about each dungeon and dungeon path.

## Dungeon Timer
_New in version 3.0_, the Dungeon Timer is a tool that is designed to help time your dungeon runs. While not designed to be a timer for "official" speed runs, it can be used for practice or as a tool to challenge yourself. Alternatively, you can use the timer to time anything else.

## WvW Tracker
The WvW Tracker overlay displays all objectives in the current player's WvW map, and includes information such as current owner, estimated time-distance to the objective, and the current RI timer value.

## WvW Notifications
WvW Notifications are notification pop-ups that appear when an objective (keep/tower/camp, etc) has been captured in one of the WvW maps.

## Trading Post Calculator
The Trading Post Calculator is a simple tool that allows a user to calculate profit, taxes, and break-even prices for buying/selling items on the in-game Trading Post.

## Trading Post Price Tracker
_New in version 3.0_, this tool allows you to continuously track/view the Highest Buy Order and Lowest Sell Listings for items without having to open the Trading Post window or visit a separate website. It includes various sort options and a basic historical data graph for viewing the change in prices for an item.

## Trading Post Price Notifications
Price Notifications are notifications that appear when an item has reached a certain highest Buy Order or lowest Sale Listing in the Trading Post. Want to know when the price of Dawn has dropped below a certain value, or when Copper Ore's Buy Orders reach a specific price? This tool will notify you of the change in price.

## Tasks Tracker
_New in version 3.0_, the Tasks Tracker is a tool for keeping track of your own personal in-game tasks. Tasks can include anything from daily crafting to gathering nodes, and include customization of icon, name, description, daily reset, and location. Tasks are stored in xml format and can be exported or loaded in order to share with others.

## Teamspeak Overlay
The Teamspeak Overlay is a basic overlay window that uses the ClientQuery plugin of Teamspeak and allows a user to see when someone talks, sends a chat, or enters/exits the current channel. The tool also allows the user to change channel and send chat messages themselves.

## Web Browser (Optional)
For all needs not provided by the other overlay windows, the Web Browser allows a user to look up guides, videos, or anything else.
