Guild Wars 2 Personal Assistant Overlay
======

# Description

A stand-alone .NET/WPF informational overlay utility for Guild Wars 2, providing events tracking, dungeon tracking, and directional/positional tracking for zone completion and WvW.

# Features
Currently, the GW2 Personal Assistant Overlay includes 10 overlay utilities:


## Events Tracker
The Events Tracker overlay tracks active and inactive world events, and allows a user to keep track of which events have already been completed for the day.

## Event Notifications
Event Notifications are notification pop-ups that appear when a world event is about to start.

## Zone Completion Assistant
The Zone Completion Assistant displays real-time distance and direction information for zone completion points/locations and provides several options for keeping track of unlocked locations.

## Dungeon Tracker
The Dungeon Tracker is a simple overlay tool that allows a user to keep track of what dungeon paths have been completed for the day, and provides some basic information about each dungeon and dungeon path.

## WvW Tracker
The WvW Tracker overlay displays all objectives in the current player's WvW map, and includes information such as current owner, estimated time-distance to the objective, and the current RI timer value.

## WvW Notifications
WvW Notifications are notification pop-ups that appear when an objective (keep/tower/camp, etc) has been captured in one of the WvW maps.

## Trading Post Calculator
The Trading Post Calculator is a simple tool that allows a user to calculate profit, taxes, and break-even prices for buying/selling items on the in-game Trading Post.

## Trading Post Price Notifications
Price Notifications are notifications that appear when an item has reached a certain highest Buy Order or lowest Sale Listing in the Trading Post. Want to know when the price of Dawn has dropped below a certain value, or when Copper Ore's Buy Orders reach a specific price? This tool will notify you of the change in price.

## Teamspeak Overlay
The Teamspeak Overlay is a basic overlay window that uses the ClientQuery plugin of Teamspeak and allows a user to see when someone talks, sends a chat, or enters/exits the current channel. The tool also allows the user to change channel and send chat messages themselves.

## Web Browser (Optional)
For all needs not provided by the other overlay windows, the Web Browser allows a user to look up guides, videos, or anything else.
